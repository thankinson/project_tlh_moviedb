            <p>The idea behind this project is to create a personal movie database of the films I own on DVD and Blu-ray.</p>
            <p>The main reason for this is that I have a large collection and donâ€™t want to buy multiple copies (again!)</p>
            <p>The other reason for this is a portfolio project to show off how i use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and databases.</p>
